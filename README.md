## üöÄ Key Features: A User's Guide

Finance Track is designed to be intuitive. Here‚Äôs a look at what you can do:

### 1. The Dashboard: Your Financial Snapshot
Get a bird's-eye view of your financial health. The main dashboard features a dynamic **Net Worth chart**, a summary of all your accounts, and your most recent transactions.

### 2. Smart Expense & Income Tracking
- **Add an Expense:** Simply enter a description and amount, and our AI will automatically categorize it.
- **Split a Bill:** Going out with friends? Use the "Split Expense" option when adding an expense to track who owes you money. Their portion will automatically appear in your "Lending" tab.
- **Add Income:** Record your salary, side hustle income, or any other money you receive.
- **Record a Loan:** If you borrow money from someone, check the "This is borrowed money" box when adding income. The app will create a debt record for you to track in the "Borrowing" page.

### 3. Accounts: All in One Place
View all your accounts, grouped by type: Bank Accounts, Credit Cards, and In-Hand Cash. Click on any account to see its detailed transaction history. You can easily add, edit, or delete accounts as needed.

### 4. Borrowing & Lending: Manage Debts with Ease
- **Borrowing Page:** See a clear list of all the money you owe. When you make a payment, you can choose to **pay in full or make a partial payment**. A full history of your repayments is always available.
- **Lending Page:** This is where you track money others owe you, whether from a split expense or a direct loan. When a friend pays you back, you can settle their debt partially or in full.
